      "work": "I started out as a biologist, specifically genetics, and studied my way to obtaining a Masters in Human and Molecular Genetics. While getting the degree I had to learn to code as the wold of genetics has a huge sum of data. I continued down the road of coding and became a bioinformatician and then eventually jumped back and forth between bioinformatics and software development. Nowadays I tend to focus more on software development, but still love bioinformatics when the opporunity arises.",
      "personal": "Outside of work I enjoy seeing new places and having as many experiences I can. My passion is gymnastics and I'll do a handstand any chance I get, as you can see to the right."
